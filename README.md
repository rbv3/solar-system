# SolarSystem

The objective of this project was to study the concepts of 3D programming with javascript using the library three.js, alongside with Angular.

## Future Work

I want to create a visualization of the translation movement of the planets. Since in the current model, my planets are way too far from each other (the distance applied is 1/100 of the real one (proportional to the radius values)), it's impossible to see all the planets into the same frustum of the camera. So, I'll create another module, using Angular's lazy loading, to present a model with the planets closer to each other, therefore, it'll be possible to check the translation of all planets.
(I still have to add Saturn's ring, I know!!!! I'll do it!!!)
